              <p>What is the one philosophy that drives SCAAL? We<br>
believe that no matter where you go, you should<br>
always be able to enjoy the simple pleasure of a<br>
good cup of coffee in a comfortable environment. At<br>
home, reading the morning paper. At your local<br>
SCAAL, conversing with a confidant. Or perhaps in<br>
some foreign land, SCAAL will be greeting you like<br>
an old friend. After all, coffee is a ritual that<br>
transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us feel<br>
alert, energetic and alive</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 24px; color: #7E7E54;"><strong>Where we began</strong></span></p>
              <p>Anders Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small<br>
                fishing village in Marstrand, Sweden. As a child, he<br>
                listened to stories of his grandfather Oluf’s<br>
                adventures and expeditions. Often his grandfather<br>
                would bring back exotic coffees for the family to<br>
                enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the<br>
                world. He worked all kinds of odd jobs. He worked in<br>
                Parisian cafes and Italian espresso bars. He worked<br>
                in the coffee fields of Brazil and New Guinea. And in<br>
                a few years, Anders learned the art of selecting the<br>
                perfect coffee bean and roasting it to perfection.</p>
              <p>He returned home in 1980 to open the first SCAAL in<br>
Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own unique<br>
blends of coffee and a stimulating atmosphere,<br>
SCAAL quickly became the place to gather – day<br>
or night – not only in Stockholm, Sweden, but 670<br>
cities around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 24px; color: #7E7E54;"><strong>What makes SCAAL the best coffee?</strong></p>
              <p>Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned<br>
                as an apprentice in the coffee fields to every buyer,<br>
                roaster, and franchise owner. SCAAL's standards for<br>
                coffee are never compromised. We only select SHB –<br>
                strictly hard bean or strictly high grown – coffee<br>
                beans. To ensure their flavorful oils are preserved,<br>
                extraordinary steps are taken to protect the coffee<br>
                bean from heat, light, air and moisture.<br>
  <br>
              </p>
              <p> All these efforts are made so that we may offer you<br>
                a perfect cup of coffee.</p>
              <p>There are so many places you could go to buy coffee.<br>
We've gone to extraordinary efforts to ensure that<br>
SCAAL is your best choice. The quality begins at<br>
harvest. SCAAL relies on selective picking, a labor-<br>
intensive process that involves making several<br>
passes among the trees for those cherries that are<br>
perfectly ripe. Then we select top grade SHB, which<br>
stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high grown.<br>
Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000<br>
feet above sea level for optimum flavor. Within<br>
hours of shipping our coffee to you, the beans are<br>
roasted on-site in small batches by a Certified<br>
Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh<br>
taste and rich aroma.</p></td>
